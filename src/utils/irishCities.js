/*
The utils (short for utilities) folder is typically used for storing:
Static data, such as lists of cities, countries, or provinces
Reusable utility functions, such as time formatting, deep cloning objects, or string conversions
Logic that is stateless and unrelated to UI
In short, it's a place for general-purpose code that can be reused across the application.
